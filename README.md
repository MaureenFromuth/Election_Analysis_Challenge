# Election Anaylsis Challenge

## Overview of Project

Our primary customers for this project, Tom and Seth, work as employees for the Colorado Board of Elections.  They have asked for support in conducting an election audit of the [tabular results](https://github.com/MaureenFromuth/Election_Analysis_Challenge/blob/master/election_results.csv) for a US Congressional Precinct in Colorado.  This data is a compilation of three primary sources to include mail-in ballots, punch cards, and direct reporting electronic counting machines.  The data is a record of each vote (row) and includes the following fields:
- Ballot ID for the voter
- County the voter voted in
- Candidate the voter voted for

Tom and Seth are conducting analysis of the election data to determine a numbner of different analytic conclusions about the results of the election.  These conclusions include:
- The total number of votes in the election
- The list of candidates who received votes
- How many votes each candidate received
- The percentage of votes each candidate recieved out of the overall vote count
- The winner of the election

After concluding the winner of the election, Tom and Seth also asked for support in anayzing the overall participation per county within the election.  Using the election data already provided, they want to identify the following conclusions about election participation:
- How many votes were conducted in each county
- What was the percentage of the overall vote occurred in each county
- Which county had the largest voter participation
